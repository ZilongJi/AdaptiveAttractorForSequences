### Required python packages top reproduce figures below:

> add the packages needed to reproduce the results here...

### Fig1: An adaptive attractor network for the place cell population
- [ ] Figure 1.1: model schematic

- [x] Figure 1.2: place field

### Fig2: Delayed spatial encoding and delay compensation by adaptation
- [x] Figure 2.1: localized bump-like network activity (1-dimensional demonstration)

- [x] Figure 2.2ï¼šsmooth tracking of the external location input $I_{ext}$

- [x] Figure 2.3: delay distance v.s. moving speed

- [x] Figure 2.4: delay distance v.s. adatation strength, we should observe that delay distance decrease as the adaptation strength increases

## @Tianhao & Xingsi: please modify each of the figures according to the hints below. Also please use the same colormap as much as possible during plot.

</p>
<em>Hint: Xaxis: switch to location. Yaxis: switch to cell index. Add noise, no smooth, no periodic boundary (cut off the two sides). Add colorbar. See Fig1c in [https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-23765-x/MediaObjects/41467_2021_23765_MOESM1_ESM.pdf] for an example.</em>

<em>Hint: @Xing si: to show the difference of Levy flight and diffusion, you have to put the scale on x and y axis. Colorbar font size is larger than font size under x axis. Make them to be consistent. </em>

</p>
<em>Hint: Make sure the color map used here is consistent with other plots. Chage the font size of x and y labels.</em>
