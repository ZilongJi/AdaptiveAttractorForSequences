### An adaptive attractor network for the place cell population
- [ ] Figure 1.1: model schematic

- [x] Figure 1.2: place field

### Delayed spatial encoding and delay compensation by adaptation
- [ ] Figure 2.1: localized bump-like network activity (1-dimensional demonstration)

- [ ] Figure 2.2ï¼šsmooth tracking of the external location input $I_{ext}$

- [ ] Figure 2.3: delay distance v.s. moving speed

- [ ] Figure 2.4: delay distance v.s. adatation strength, we should observe that delay distance decrease as the adaptation strength increases

- [ ] Figure 2.5: fixing $m=\tau/tau_v$, plot delay distance as a function of moving speed

### Online sequential activation resembles theta sweeps
- [ ] Figure 3.1: forward theta sweeps

- [ ] Figure 3.2: phase precession (unimodal cell)

- [ ] Figure 3.3: bi-directional theta sweeps

- [ ] Figure 3.4: phase precession interleaved with phase procession (bimodal cell)

### Offline sequential activation resemble hippocampal replay dynamics
- [ ] Figure 4.1: demonstration of diffusion and super-diffusion in 2D space

- [ ] Figure 4.2: histogram plot of probability v.s. step sizes for diffusion and super-diffusion

- [ ] Figure 4.3: Phase diagram

- [ ] Figure 4.4: Levy exponent v.s. adaptation strength; Levy exponent v.s. noise strength

### Anti-correlation between neural activity and movement trajectory
- [x] Figure 5: already done
